# Haven Space - Product Alignment Plan

## Problem Statement

**Current Issue:** The landlord and boarder dashboards focus primarily on listing/reserving boarding houses, but don't adequately solve the **actual problems** identified in the project pitch.

---

## Core Problems (From Pitch)

### Student/Boarder Problems

1. **Physically exhausting search process** - Students walk from one boarding house to another in the heat
2. **Time-consuming** - Hours wasted searching for vacancies
3. **Incomplete/inaccurate information** - Listings lack key details (price, location, rules, wifi, policies)
4. **Difficulty comparing options** - No centralized way to evaluate multiple properties
5. **No secure payment system** - Trust issues and financial risk
6. **Poor communication** - Relies on disconnected channels (SMS, phone, social media)

### Landlord Problems

1. **Manual record keeping** - Paper forms, handwriting, prone to errors and loss
2. **Difficulty reaching tenants** - No centralized marketplace
3. **Manual tenant screening** - No systematic background checking
4. **Cash flow tracking challenges** - Manual rent collection, receipt writing
5. **No standardized processes** - Booking processes vary wildly
6. **Communication fragmentation** - Group chats, phone calls, SMS for reminders

## Technical Debt Considerations

### Current Implementation Issues

1. **Static data** - All dashboard data is hardcoded, needs API integration
2. **No authentication flow** - Role detection is URL-based, not secure
3. **No database schema** - Backend needs complete data model
4. **No payment infrastructure** - Critical gap for core value proposition
5. **No notification system** - Essential for reminders and updates

### Migration Strategy

1. Keep current UI structure but replace static content with API calls
2. Implement proper authentication before adding sensitive features
3. Build payment integration as highest priority backend task
4. Add notification system (email/SMS) in parallel with payment work

- [ ] Integrate payment gateway
- [ ] Build application workflow
- [ ] Implement notification system
- [ ] Add search and filtering

### Week 5-6: Polish

## Conclusion

The current dashboard implementation provides a **visual foundation** but doesn't solve the **core problems** identified in the pitch. This plan outlines the pivot needed to transform Haven Space from a "listing platform" into a **comprehensive management solution** that:

1. ✅ Eliminates physical house hunting (advanced search, map view, virtual tours)
2. ✅ Provides transparent information (complete details, reviews, verified badges)
3. ✅ Secures payments (online processing, digital receipts, auto-reminders)
4. ✅ Streamlines operations (automated rent collection, digital contracts, financial reports)
5. ✅ Improves communication (bulk announcements, structured messaging, notifications)

**Priority:** Focus on Phase 1 features first - these directly address the problems stated by Jely (student) and Yhang (landlord) in the pitch.
